# SkeeterBuster
Aedes aegypti population dynamics simulation model. Both models assume a linux-based C++ compiler and development environment.

Please see subdirectories for details:
* `sb/`: original SkeeterBuster model. Grid-based spatial configuraiton. Primarily of historical interest. 
* `sb2/`: SkeeterBuster 2. List-based spatial configuration of houses. Includes location-specific sampling and spraying, improved user interface, and simple test cases.
